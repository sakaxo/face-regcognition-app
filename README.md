## Face recognition mobile app for enhanced course registration and fee payment Identification

In the majority of institutions, it can be difficult to determine which students have signed up for courses and paid their fees. 
Due to inconsistencies in attendance monitoring and challenges confirming students' eligibility for exams, the school struggles to
effectively identify pupils who have completed these duties. 
The institution's academic management system is less successful overall as a result of this administrative inefficiencies.

There are two ways to solve this issue: 
> 1. A mobile app for student identification and verification. This program requests information on a captured student from the concerned school's web API. Information includes whether a student has registered for classes and paid any costs.

> 2. This section is a web API built with Django that contains data on each student enrolled in the institution.
